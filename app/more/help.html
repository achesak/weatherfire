      <h3>Adding Data</h3>
      <p>This app isn't very useful if you can't add any data!</p>
      <p>To get started, go to the main screen and tap the button labeled "Add" in the bottom left corner. This will take you to the 
      add screen, from which you can start adding weather data. The first and most important thing to add is the date; if there's no
      date, the data can't be stored! After that, enter the other fields. Most of them are required; the only exceptions are the wind
      speed and precipitation amount fields, and those can only be left blank if the wind direction and precipitation type, respectively,
      are set to "None".</p>
      <p>Once everything is entered, tap the "Add Data" button at the bottom of the screen. If there are no problems with the data you
      have entered, the data will be added and you will be taken to the main screen. From there you can view all the data you have entered
      so far. If there <em>are</em> problems, a popup will appear to tell you what's wrong.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div data-role="collapsible">
      <h3>Getting Information</h3>
      <p>Adding data isn't very useful if you can't do anything with it! That's why there are the info screens. They allow you to see the
      low, high, average, median, and range of the data, in addition to other things.</p>
      <p>The info screens can be accessed by going to the main screen and tapping the "Info" button at the bottom. From there you can select
      which info screen to view.</p>
      <p>The general info screen shows some basic information about all of the data. There are a few items relating to the dates, and then the
      lows, highs, and averages of the other data. If you would like to view more in-depth information, go to one of the more specific info screens.
      For example, the general info screen only shows the low, high, and average for the precipitation, but the precipitation info screen also
      shows the median, range, total amount of precipitation, total amount of each type of precipitation, and the number of days of each type
      of precipitation.</p>

    <div data-role="collapsible">
      <h3>Removing Data</h3>
      <p>Entered some data incorrectly or decided that you want to start over? No problem, Weatherfire allows you to delete data that 
      has previously been entered.</p>
      <p>If you would like to only remove one day's worth of data, then go to the main screen and tap on the button labeled "Remove" at
      the bottom. This will take you to the remove screen. On this screen you will be presented with a list of the days that have been 
      entered. Select a day and press "Remove Data" and *poof*! The data is gone!</p>
      <p>If you want to delete everything that has been entered, then go to the main screen, tap on "More", and then tap on "Clear Data". 
      You will then need to confirm that you want to clear the data. Make sure you are absolutely certain that you want to do this first!
      This action cannot be undone!<p>
